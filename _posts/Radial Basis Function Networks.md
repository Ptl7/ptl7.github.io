There are two way to handle non-linear maching learning model
The most prominent example is : 
k-nearest neighbors
     - Classification : $h(x) = sign (\Sigma y_i)$
     - Regression : $h(x) = \frac{1}{k} \Sigma y_i

Radial Basis Function(RBF) measures \bold{contributions of each training data point with respect to its distance to the test point}
