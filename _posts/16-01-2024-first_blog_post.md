#My first blog post
  
  <p>I am not sure if I can do this. I don't have a big vocabulary and any writing experience. English is not even my first language.
I learnt english mostly by reading news articles, reading all kinds of books, reddit posts/comments(I have moved on to lemmy now) etc,.
I have always been a lurker in any community I happened to join like reddit, discord,twitch and now lemmy. I have not even talked this
openly with any of my family members or friends. I always feel like people will judge me if they know how I feel. So, I keep my thoughts
about how I feel, my personal preferences and what I want to do in my life to myself.</p>

<p>  Right know, I am doing this because I no longer can hold these thoughts in my brain. Also, I am 100% sure nobody is going to read this
non-sense rambling from a random dude who don't even know to what to do with his life. When I was in school or even while doing graduation
(atleast in the first 2 years) I was the topper of my class. I was not even studying much, I was just listening to the lecture diligently and 
reproducing whatever I learnt in the class in the exams. But after those 2 years, I don't know what happened, I started bunking class to just
sleep in my hostel room and I couldn't focus while I tried to study.  </p>
