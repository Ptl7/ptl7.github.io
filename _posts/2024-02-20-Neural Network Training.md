## Neural Network Training

1. Optimizations
- Mini-batch SGD
- Learning rate decay
- Diagnosing learning curves
- Adaptive optimization methods such as SGD with momentum, RMSProp, Adam



2. Massaging the numbers
- Data augmentation
- Data preprocessing
- Weight initialization
- Batch normalization

3. Regularization
4. Test Time - averaging predictions and ensembles

5.
