## Convolutional Architecture 2

1. AlexNet

**Max Pooling**: AlexNet introduced the use of max pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions of the input volume for the subsequent layers. 
Max pooling helps in reducing the computational load and also helps in making the detection of features invariant to scale and orientation changes.

ReLU Nonlinearity: AlexNet was one of the first convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as the activation function, which was a departure from the sigmoid functions commonly used at the time. ReLUs help in solving the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn faster and perform better.
